- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned the use of box shadows


### Continued development

I want to keep improving my Tailwind skills. I want to be able to create any website without editing CSS directly.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind shadow documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow) - This helped me to discover how to use shadows with Tailwind.
